		</p>

			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
		</p>
		<blockquote> <!-- a block quote will make a quote that stands out from the rest of the text by padding the top and bottom with new lines and indenting -->
			Passing cars,<br> <!-- The typical line break -->
			When you can't see,<br>
			May get you,<br>
			A glimpse,<br>
			Of Eternity.<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			I definately won't be passing any cars.

		<p>
			My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
		</p>
		<!--  you can nest a list -->
		<ol>
			<li>Charge segway</li>
			<li>Pack for trip</li>
			<ul> <!-- unordered list i.e. bullet list -->
				<li>cellphone</li>
				<li>iPod</li>
				<li>digital camera</li>
				<li>and a protein bar</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Call Mom</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one segway.</q> <!-- mark something as an inline quote. -->
