			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and i passed through some interesting places along the way:
	
			Walla Walla, WA
			Magic City, ID
			Bountiful, UT
			Last Chance, CO
			Truth or Consequences, NM
			Why, AZ
			
		</p>
		
		<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>

			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
			<blockquote>
				Passing cars,
				When you can't see,
				May get you,
				A glimpse,
				Of Eternity.
			</blockquote>
			I definately won't be passing any cars.

			My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
			cellphone
			iPod
			digital camera
			and a protein bar
			Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said,
			<q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one segway.</q>
